Julius and Ethel Rosenberg died in the electric chair at Sing Sing Prison, New York.
Their death marked the end of the most notorious political affair in America in the nineteen fifties, and came over two years after their sentencing for the crime of spying for the Soviet Union. 
It came in spite of some 21,000 petitions and telegrams to the White House, demanding clemency, from people, organisations and governments in North America and Europe, including Albert Einstein.
It was, in a way, the climax of McCarthyism. 
At the time the American press, full of a manic fear and hatred of communists and anything that could be considered "leftist" fully supported the verdict.
Only one major paper, the National Guardian, saw anything wrong in the trial, anything excessive in the verdict.
The Rosenbergs were sentenced principally on the word of Ethel Rosenberg's brother David, an employee at the Atomic Research Center at Los Alamos, who admitted having handed the Russians plans of US atomic weapons; he accused Julius Rosenberg of having recruited him. 
But what was all the hassle about ? David's A-bomb plans, handed to the Russians, were no more than "a poor caricature", in the words of the bomb's inventor, "A drawing unable to give any worthwhile information". Some other accusations were proved to be false, too, and throughout the trial, the Rosenbergs themselves maintained their innocence.
By normal standards of justice, there was little in the affair that could justify a sentence of death.
