Yet a direct hit by the "Big One" is just one of many potential disasters that could befall L.A.
If an earthquake or some other event were to cut off the city's water supplies for more than 24 hours, L.A. would begin to disintegrate.
Located on and around a hot coastal plain where it does not often rain, L.A. can only survive thanks to vast aqueduct systems that bring in millions of gallons of water a day from hundreds of miles away.
A prolonged power failure, or disruption of gasoline supplies, could be just as devastating.

Apart from the fact that there is (as yet) no local volcano on the edge of L.A., and that tornadoes are unknown in this part of the U.S.A., the risk of natural disaster is greater in L.A. than any other U.S. city.
San Francisco, devastated by an earthquake in 1906 and seriously rocked in 1989, is just as much at risk from an earthquake as L.A. - though less at risk from other causes.
In both of California's big cities, schools and workplaces are required to have earthquake emergency procedures, designed to minimize loss of life; and all modern buildings must be built according to strict regulations.
When the "Big One" comes, it is sure to do a lot of damage; but when will it come? that's a question to which everyone would like to know the answer!.
